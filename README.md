# snake
***
I do not plan on working on the game beyond this. I got the main functionality working which was my main goal.
<br>If you want to add in something you're welcome to contribute.
### install
You'll need the .png file as well as the main.py and gamefunctions.py in one folder.
<br>Then just run the main.py file.

note you will need python3 and pygame to run the game. You can install pygame with
> pip3 install pygame
### controls
Arrow buttons to control snake direction.
<br>Space to restart the game.
